# Chatlog
A chat logging moderation tool for Trouble in Terrorist Town, based on the Damagelogs addon by Tommy228. https://github.com/Tommy228/tttdamagelogs

This addon tracks all messages sent in a TTT round and sets a timestamp to each one of them based on how much time has passed since the start of the round, for easy resolution of conflicts and RDM/KOS reports in-game.

## Features

* Messages sent to team chats are highlighted
* Messages sent by dead people are easily distinguished and filtered out
* Round and player filtering
* Easy to translate by writing language files (includes English, Spanish and Turkish languages by default)
* Easy configuration of privileges for usergroups, to choose who can or can't see rounds in progress or spectator chats

### Installation

Drop the 'chatlogs' folder into the /addons/ directory, inside your Garry's Mod installation.
